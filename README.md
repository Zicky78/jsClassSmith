# Week 06 Video 01 My Thoughts
### *by Zachary Smith*

>## Notes:
>
>- ### I agree with not copy/pasting, unless you can go through the copied code and understand how/why everything works.
>- ### Also, most code snippets aren't going to integrate right into your project without some tweaking, so you need to know what you are copying most of the time anyway
>
>- ### Good catch on the multiple modules being included in the html, I haven't used them too much so I didn't know you could exclude it in the html as long as you still import it in other files that use it
>
>- ### I'm solid on the github workflow and my dev environment is all set up, so no issues there
