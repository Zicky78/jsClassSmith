# Week 8

## Forms Experience

### The worst forms I've seen are the ones used in the medical field. My mom is a nurse and I've seen her order supplies from a .html site that was quite literally a basic html form with ZERO css, and contained mostly dropdowns that would have 30+ options each. Some of the websites and software I see her use have got to be some of the most low-budget buggy spaghetti-coded pieces of junk in existence. 

## What code do we want to run in the eventListener?

### We're getting our user input, so we want to call the functions we've set up with that input, process it, and return the output to our lovely user

## Did this make sense?

### Yes, I completely understood it. One note, I think because I used .toFixed(2) for my rounding, I didnt get the NaN error. Not sure though
