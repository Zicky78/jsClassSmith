## App Idea

I've been on a big weight-loss journey, so the first thing that came to mind is a calorie counting app.
Users could create food entries with the name, number of calories, amount, etc. Maybe have the system clock log when the entry
was inputted and organize them by date, so theres a running log of what was eaten on which day. Also each entry would total that day's
calories as entries were created. I can also include exercise logging for type of activity, duration, and calories burned, which would subtract from that day's total.

To start with though, I can go through my own decision making process for exercise and nutrition. Though the exercise part doesn't really require any decision making. I have a routine and I do that routine on the 4 days I don't work, so I won't be including that in this part.

I added day of the week and some conditions like am I working or is it a cheat day to figure out what I'm likely to eat on any given day. I looked up online or in my fridge for the calorie info, and then I add that to a running total for that day
