## Week 13

Okay so I made my design in figma yesterday (monday), which I probably spent way more time on than necessary since I am not a designer, but still wanted things to look pretty haha. I included screenshots of it, though I was having trouble importing images to it for some reason so the edit / delete icon buttons are missing.

Next I asked ChatGPT to kindly make me a modal cause I didn't like the w3school's one. It forgot the open-modal button and function though so I had to remind it to add that (I don't have GPT4 yet), but after that I was able to cut/paste my form over into it no problem.

I also spent some time asking it a lot of CSS-best-practices questions since I'm even rustier at CSS than designing. I was hoping there was a way to import / export the custom variables like you can for modules in JS, but it seems that for smaller projects with only a few variables its better to just re-define them to save on requests during page load time. 

I got github copilot over the weekend and it was great for auto-completing CSS and keeping things semi-consistent. Once the bulk of the CSS is done I need to go back in and make things more standardized, but I wouldn't have gotten nearly as far into completing the CSS doing it on my own. So far I haven't really found much use for it beyond a more intelligent auto-complete though.

I think this is a good stopping point for this assignment, the rest of it is fine tuning the CSS to get as close to my mockup as possible, and adjusting my rendering function to match, which will be done for week 14.

Week 15 - Edit and Delete

Week 16 - Local Storage

Week 17 - AI's gain sentience and self-awareness

Week 18 - Survive the AI apocalypse and still somehow try to pass finals

I also need to add functionality to close the modal upon submit.
