## Week 16

### Feedback

I thought to ask ChatGPT first but after I got done typing the header and method, github copilot automatically suggested ```body: JSON.stringify({})``` so it wasn't needed. 

As for feedback to your approach, I only have positive things to say. I think it's important to get familiar with reading through documentation, and I think the ChatGPT API is going to be very important to learn.
