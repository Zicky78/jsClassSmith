## What I know about JSON

JSON is a format for storing data and is commonly used for sending data over the web. It is stored as a string which makes it quick to transfer.

You can use built in methods parse(JSON) and stringify(Object) to convert to and from JSON

Somehow I've never seen that bracket notation to access object properties, so that was interesting to learn about. Not entirely sure how useful it is, I haven't really encountered a situation where I needed the object property name stored in a variable, but I'll keep it in mind
