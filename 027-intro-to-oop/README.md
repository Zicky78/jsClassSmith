## Week 13 - Intro to OOP

### Do you see the difference between object literals and constructed objects?

Yes! My first programming classes were CSCI 40 and 41 with C++, and while it's not my favorite language, not using constructors has been weird. Though now I wanna refactor my app code to put the functions into the class as well, which might actually help with tackling the pagination feature I want to add

### Does the prototype chain and the student subclass make sense?

Yes! As I understand it, you can also call super on the parent class methods inside the subclass definition if you wanted that to run first, like in this instance displaying all of the personal information before displaying the class list.
