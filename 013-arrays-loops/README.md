# Week 7

## How well did you understand this week's concepts?

### Very clearly understand the concepts. Abstraction is one of my favorite things about programming. Abstracting a project to be made into code is fun, and abstracting code to be more efficient, readable, and functional is fun too.

## Feedback

### I like the structure of the class so far. Coding along while learning the concepts ensures you see them in action, and that you have working code as well. Then there are the coding challenges and spots to change up the code, to reinforce the concepts. 

### The main way to learn to code is to implement what you are learning into the code you write, which seems obvious, but sometimes people don't code on their own and practice, so those sections are good for that.
