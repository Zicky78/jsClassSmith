# Week 10

## function vs =>

## My philosophy is that I use function syntax if the code inside will be reused in other places in my program, and arrow functions 
## for callbacks or quick one-line functions, or things that only get used once. function syntax is cleaner, because you don't use const to get 
## confused with other variables at a glance. I love arrow functions though, they're really nice utility
