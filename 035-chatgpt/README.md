## Week 16

### ChatGPT prompts

As you already know, I've been using ChatGPT for a lot haha. I've been asking it tons of little questions about html, css, and js since starting this course just to get best practices or figure out why something was or wasn't working. 

I've used ChatGPT to:
- figure out how to check for event listeners
- fix my css when things weren't aligning properly
- the website that applies color filters based on hex code was suggested by ChatGPT when I asked it how to create a color shift on hover effect
- fixing DOM append issues
- debugging a function where I used !foo === bar instead of foo !== bar by mistake
- explain js concepts further like how modules are read and destructuring
- get tips for best practices when coding

Non-programming related:
- put together healthy recipes and meal plans
- get information about obscure old video games that don't have wikis
- tell it to act as a prompt engineer for making midjourney prompts, and giving it a list of parameters on how to do that. Once it knew it's job, I could input a simple subject like "sea turtle" and get a verbose prompt to paste into midjourney to get higher quality art

Using ChatGPT and Github Copilot in my workflow has been really fun and really powerful, but I can definitely see that there are still a lot of limitations to them. For instance, I put in some code from my render function to see what it thought, and the conversation went as follows:

>ChatGPT-4: Use consistent naming conventions: It's a good idea to use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and CSS classes, to make the code easier to read and understand. For example, you could use **itemOutput** consistently instead of **itemOutput** and **outputItem** in different parts of the code
>>Me: where is **outputItem**? i dont see that in my code
>>>ChatGPT-4: I apologize for the confusion, I meant **itemOutput** instead of **outputItem**. In the code, there are several places where the **itemOutput** variable is used, but it is sometimes referred to as **outputItem** instead. To maintain consistency and avoid confusion, you could use the same variable name throughout the code.
>>>>Me: where is it referred to as **outputItem**?
>>>>>ChatGPT-4: I apologize for my mistake earlier, upon reviewing the code again, I do not see any instances where **outputItem** is used instead of **itemOutput**. I must have misspoken earlier, I apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

Maybe the AI are closer to us than we think. I've certainly been over-confidently incorrect before. Jokes aside, it's been important to review any output that's been given to make sure that it's giving accurate information. 

Midjourney also just does not know what a lava lamp is. It's idea of a lava lamp is an slightly rounded Erlenmeyer flask filled with rainbow fire. Admittedly that's pretty cool, but it's **not** a lava lamp.
