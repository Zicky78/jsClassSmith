## Week 16

### Do you run the code when you code along with me?

Yes, I always run the code to check if it runs, because I usually try and make things my own or add in things for fun haha.

Thankfully I also have my developer portal for spotify set up since I've used their api in the past.

### Why fetch?

1. Native support
2. No installation
3. Modern features
4. Modern promise syntax
